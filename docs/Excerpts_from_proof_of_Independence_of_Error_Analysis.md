# Meaning of Independence of Errors
- This is an assumption in regression models that the error terms (residuals) are statistically independent from one another.
- If residuals are correlated (which means autocorrelation is present), it can suggest that the model is missing some important information or structure, such as a variable that captures the effect causing the autocorrelation.
- Violation of this assumption can lead to inefficient estimates and issues with hypothesis testing, potentially misleading conclusions about the relationship between the variables of interest.

When the Independence of Errors assumption holds, the residuals from one observation do not provide any information about the residuals of another observation. When it is violated due to autocorrelation, it means that past errors could influence or predict the current error, which is problematic for the statistical properties of the estimators in a regression model.
