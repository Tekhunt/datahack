# BENGALURU HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

## Project Description:

Our team is tasked with building a regression model to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India. The project aims to provide valuable insights to potential homebuyers and stakeholders in the real estate industry. With factors such as location, property size, proximity to key amenities, and market trends influencing house prices, the project will involve comprehensive data analysis and modeling techniques. By leveraging datasets containing information on housing attributes and market trends, we aim to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist homebuyers in making informed decisions and provide insights to stakeholders in the real estate sector. Through meticulous data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and validation, our team endeavors to create a robust regression model that captures the nuances of Bengaluru's housing market dynamics.
