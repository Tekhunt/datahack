## 3. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Assigned to David - Ungest)
Task: Lead the SVR implementation, utilizing kernel functions to capture intricate non-linear relationships.

## 4. Gradient Boosting Regression (Assigned to TechKene - Kene)
Task: Take charge of gradient boosting regression, combining multiple weak learners to capture complex patterns in the data.

## 5. ElasticNet Regression (Assigned to Ekemini Mbabah)
Task: Head our ElasticNet regression efforts, balancing L1 and L2 regularization to capture both linear and non-linear relationships.

### **Please ensure that your assigned task is completed by then to maintain project progress.**


## Previous Task
## ekeminimbaba - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

**Assignment**: This team member will handle data cleaning, addressing missing values, outliers, and preprocessing tasks to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Tasks:
- Prove the **'No or Little Multicollinearity'** assumption.
- Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Standardize or normalize numerical features if necessary.
- Encode categorical variables appropriately.
- Document the cleaning and preprocessing steps taken.

### PS: This task being the first task is very crucial. it needs to be closed out quickly because all the other tasks are dependent on its completion.

## Afezhus (Afeez) (ungest will be assisting Afeez on this) - Feature Engineering and Selection.

**Assignment**: This team member will focus on creating new features, exploring interactions, and selecting the most relevant features for modeling.

### Tasks:
- Prove the **'Homoscedasticity'** assumption.
- Explore feature interactions and create new features based on domain knowledge.
- Conduct feature selection to choose the most important predictors for the model.
- Document the feature engineering process and rationale for feature selection decisions.



## ccinaza (Naza) - Model Development and Optimization:

**Assignment**: This team member will be responsible for building, training, and optimizing regression models to predict house prices.

### Tasks:
- Prove the **'Linearity'** assumption.
- Select appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train multiple models and tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.



## TechKene (Kene) - Validation and Model Evaluation:

**Assignment**: This team member will validate the model's performance, conduct additional evaluations, and provide insights into its effectiveness.

### Tasks:
- Prove the **'Normal Distribution of Errors'** assumption.
- Validate the trained models using unseen data and cross-validation techniques.
- Perform additional evaluations such as sensitivity analysis or residual analysis.
- Provide insights into the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement.
- Document the validation and evaluation results for the team's reference.

**Additionally, kindly generate a requirements.txt file for our project**

## ungest (David) - Results Communication and Documentation:

**Assignment**: This team member will be responsible for communicating the results of the analysis effectively and documenting the entire process.

### Tasks:
- Prove the '**Independence of Errors'** assumption.
- Prepare visualizations to present key findings and insights.
- Document the data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps.
- Summarize the model development process and results.
- Create a final report or presentation for stakeholders.
- Prepare any necessary documentation for future reference.


## Tekhunt (Chizzy) 
Your assignment is to provide supervisory guidance throughout the project lifecycle. This includes overseeing the data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation processes. Your expertise will be instrumental in making strategic decisions, resolving any challenges that arise, and ensuring the final model meets our objectives effectively. 

Each team member is expected to collaborate closely throughout the project, sharing insights, discussing challenges, and providing feedback to ensure the success of the project.
